## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

This was a really interesting challenge. I practice a little bit more about error handling, also I'm starting o understand a little better callbacks :) that is exiting.
It was really interesting to have to create color themes, I approached it as I was used to and realized that that is not the way to do it. By creating variables that can change with javascript is way better.

### Continued development

I need to get more comfortable with grid, I was able to achieve the result with out it but I feel that I would be able to position things a little better with grid. I need to feel good using it and not be afraid to change classes and order in order to achieve what I want to achieve.

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/color-schemes-with-css-variables-and-javascript--cms-36989) - This helped me understand a little better how to achieve the change of color scheme.
